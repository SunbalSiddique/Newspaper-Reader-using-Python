# Newspaper-Reader-using-Python
The repository contains the code to create a newspaper reader using Python. 

The project uses the API from the "www.newsapi.org" website.
The user chooses the desired country and newspaper.
The designed "Newspaper Reader" then reads the top 10 headlines from that newspaper.
